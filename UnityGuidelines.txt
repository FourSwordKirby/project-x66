General Guidelines

General GameObject (Prefab) Structure

> Object - core script on it, rigidbody2d, animator, audio player, things that apply for the whole object
  > Mesh/Sprite - The sprite, make sure its at (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), makes it easier to swap out later
  > Collider1 - scripts relevant to this particular collider
  > Collider2 - E.g. clickable script 

This means: On the root game object, put CoreScript on it, RigidBody on it, Animator...
On a CHILD GameObject called "Mesh", put the Mesh component.
    Make sure the pivot and feet are at (0,0,0) so we can line up with the world floor
On a CHILD GameObject, call it Collider, and put any scripts relevant to only that collider there.



Core script on the root object
"Attributes" on subobjects (with their own collider if necessary)
E.g. if a part is "Destructable" on a certain part of an object, make a subobject with a collider in that part of the object with a script called "Destructable"

For scripts on subobjects:
  Start() { core = transform.parent.GetComponent<CoreScript> }
  Collider2, attach a "MouseController" script, OnMouseClick { core.Death(); core.Hit(); //etc }
  
Always leave things enabled in the editor
Disable GameObject with GameObject.SetActive(false) in Start() if it shouldn't be visible immediately
  
Awake() - initializing variable related to self
Start() - any references to other objects
